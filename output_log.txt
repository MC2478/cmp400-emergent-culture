How many steps should the simulation run for? [default: 25]
Step 1:
  World: season=spring (food/wood yield x1.00), next=spring
  West: action=mixed_allocation (LLM: yes)
    - Reason: Prioritizing food growth to meet immediate needs and wealth production for future infrastructure investment.
    - Work allocation: focus_food:0.50, focus_wealth:0.50

    - Resources: food 3.00->3.50, wealth 5.00->5.12, wood 0.00->0.00, infra 0->0
    - Population: 100

  Negotiation at step 1 (gift_from_west):

      East: "We appreciate the opportunity to establish a dialogue with the West. Our initial assessment suggests that our current resources are sufficient, but we're open to exploring mutually beneficial arrangements."
      West: "Thank you for your willingness to engage in diplomacy. We too believe in cooperation and would like to discuss potential areas of collaboration while ensuring the stability of both our nations."
      East: "We've taken note of your current food reserves, which seem slightly lower than ours. Perhaps we could consider a temporary aid package to help stabilize your situation?"
      West: "Your offer is appreciated, but we'd like to propose a more balanced approach. We're willing to share some of our wealth in exchange for a long-term commitment to mutual cooperation and trade."

Step 2:
  World: season=spring (food/wood yield x1.00), next=summer
  West: action=mixed_allocation (LLM: yes)
    - Reason: Prioritize food growth to meet immediate needs and wealth production for future infrastructure investment. With a sufficient food buffer (1.10 gap) and cordial relations with the East, I can afford to allocate some work towards building up our wealth reserves.
