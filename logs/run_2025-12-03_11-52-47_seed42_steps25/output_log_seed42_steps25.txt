Step 25:
  World: season=spring (food/wood yield x1.00), next=spring
  West: action=mixed_allocation (LLM: yes)
    - Reason:
      Immediate food production is crucial to prevent starvation and maintain a stable population; allocating more resources towards food will help cover the next 3 steps' needs.
    - Work allocation: focus_food:0.95, focus_wood:0.02, focus_wealth:0.03, focus_iron:0.00, focus_gold:0.00
    - Infrastructure attempt: failed
    - Traits: [Food-secure] - I protect food reserves before anything else (cooldown 4)
      Pressures: exploitation=0, starvation=0, failed_strategy=0
    - Population: 554 -> 554

  East: action=mixed_allocation (LLM: yes)
    - Reason:
      Cover food/wages for the next 3 steps before chasing prosperity and prepare infrastructure upgrades to increase resource production.
    - Work allocation: focus_food:0.90, focus_wood:0.05, focus_wealth:0.05, focus_iron:0.00, focus_gold:0.00
    - Infrastructure attempt: failed
    - Traits: [Opportunistic] - I pivot quickly when leverage appears (cooldown 0)
      Pressures: exploitation=0, starvation=0, failed_strategy=0
    - Population: 985 -> 985

  Negotiation at step 25 (outcome=declined, trade_type=no_trade), turns=6:

      (1) East: "Considering our surplus wealth and your critical food needs, I propose a trade of up to 1.2 food for 0.8 wealth." [offer] | offer: food 1.2, wealth 0.8, woodE 0.0, woodW 0.0, ironE 0.0, ironW 0.0, goldE 0.0, goldW 0.0
      (2) West: "We cannot accept such a generous offer without considering our own food buffer and the current food safety ratio. Let's rebalance the exchange with more modest terms." [counter] | offer: food 0.8, wealth 1.2, woodE 0.0, woodW 0.0, ironE 0.0, ironW 0.0, goldE 0.0, goldW 0.0
      (3) East: "Considering your critical food needs and our surplus wealth, I'm willing to rebalance the exchange with a more substantial return for your aid.

      (6) West: "We cannot accept such a generous offer without considering our own food buffer and the current food safety ratio. Let's rebalance the exchange with more modest terms. (Too many counters; ending talks.)" [decline]
